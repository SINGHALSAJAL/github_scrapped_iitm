# GitHub Users in Chicago with Over 100 Followers

- I scraped the data using GitHub's API, fetching users in Chicago with over 100 followers, along with their repositories.
- Surprisingly, many repositories did not have licenses, which can limit collaboration.
- Developers should ensure their repositories have proper licenses to encourage open-source contributions.
